#===============================================================================
#                      Default Configuration for LSQ-Net
#===============================================================================
# Please do NOT modify this file directly. If you want to modify configurations,
# please:
# 1. Create a new YAML file and copy some bellowing options to it.
# 2. Modify these options in your YAML file.
# 3. run main.py with your configuration file in the command line, like this:
#       $ python main.py path/to/your/config/file
# The options modified in your configuration file will overwrite those in this
# file.
